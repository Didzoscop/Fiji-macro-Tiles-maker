Tiles Maker is a macro for ImageJ, which allows to automate the creation of figures of fluorescent microscopy images. This project is part of my master degree internship. 
The aim of this macro is not to generate “ready-to-publish” figures for your paper, but rather to facilitate the visualization of large batches of microscopy images, particularly for supplementary data.
The idea is to provide a standardized way to display an intermediate form of “raw data,” allowing readers or reviewers to visually inspect the image sets used for quantitative analysis — without having to manually open each individual .tif file, which can be time-consuming and impractical.
